The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications.

Rationale:

Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw.

This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp.

Solution:
Configure /etc/fstab as appropriate.

example:
tmpfs/tmptmpfs     defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime  0 0

OR
Run the following commands to enable systemd /tmp mounting:

systemctl unmask tmp.mount
systemctl enable tmp.mount

Edit /etc/systemd/system/local-fs.target.wants/tmp.mount to configure the /tmp mount:

[Mount]
What=tmpfs
Where=/tmp
Type=tmpfs
Options=mode=1777,strictatime,noexec,nodev,nosuid

Impact:

Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition.

Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a default installation a disk-based /tmp will essentially have the whole disk available, as it only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp as with tmpfs will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily.

/tmp utalizing tmpfs can be resized using the size={size} parameter on the Options line on the tmp.mount file

autofs allows automatic mounting of devices, typically including CD/DVDs and USB drives.

Rationale:

With automounting enabled anyone with physical access could attach a USB drive or disc and have its contents available in system even if they lacked permissions to mount it themselves.

Solution:
Run one of the following commands:
Run the following command to disable autofs :

# systemctl --now disable autofs

OR
Run the following command to remove autofs

# apt purge autofs

Impact:

The use of portable hard drives is very common for workstation users. If your organization allows the use of portable storage or media on workstations and physical access controls to workstations is considered adequate there is little value add in turning off automounting.

Notes:

Additional methods of disabling a service exist. Consult your distribution documentation for appropriate methods.

This control should align with the tolerance of the use of portable drives and optical media in the organization. On a server requiring an admin to manually mount media can be part of defense-in-depth to reduce the risk of unapproved software or information being introduced or proprietary software or information being exfiltrated. If admins commonly use flash drives and Server access has sufficient physical controls, requiring manual mounting may not increase security.

USB storage provides a means to transfer and store files insuring persistence and availability of the files independent of network connection status. Its popularity and utility has led to USB-based malware being a simple and common means for network infiltration and a first step to establishing a persistent threat within a networked environment.

sudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified by the security policy. The invoking user's real (not effective) user ID is used to determine the user name with which to query the security policy.

Rationale:

sudo supports a plugin architecture for security policies and input/output logging. Third parties can develop and distribute their own policy and I/O logging plugins to work seamlessly with the sudo front end. The default security policy is sudoers, which is configured via the file /etc/sudoers.

The security policy determines what privileges, if any, a user has to run sudo. The policy may require that users authenticate themselves with a password or another authentication mechanism. If authentication is required, sudo will exit if the user's password is not entered within a configurable time limit. This limit is policy-specific.

Solution:
Install sudo using the following command.

# apt install sudo

OR

# apt install sudo-ldap

Description: Provide limited super user privileges to specific users
 Sudo is a program designed to allow a sysadmin to give limited root
 privileges to users and log root activity.  The basic philosophy is to give
 as few privileges as possible but still allow people to get their work done.
 .
 This version is built with minimal shared library dependencies, use the
 sudo-ldap package instead if you need LDAP support for sudoers.

AIDE takes a snapshot of filesystem state including modification times, permissions, and file hashes which can then be used to compare against the current state of the filesystem to detect modifications to the system.

Rationale:

By monitoring the filesystem state compromised files can be detected to prevent or limit the exposure of accidental or malicious misconfigurations or modified binaries.

Solution:
Install AIDE using the appropriate package manager or manual installation:

# apt install aide aide-common

Configure AIDE as appropriate for your environment. Consult the AIDE documentation for options.
Initialize AIDE:

# aideinit

Notes:

The prelinking feature can interfere with AIDE because it alters binaries to speed up their start up times. Run prelink -ua to restore the binaries to their prelinked state, thus avoiding false positives from AIDE.

The grub configuration file contains information on boot settings and passwords for unlocking boot options. The grub configuration is usually grub.cfg stored in /boot/grub/.

Rationale:

Setting the permissions to read and write for root only prevents non-root users from seeing the boot parameters or changing them. Non-root users who read the boot parameters may be able to identify weaknesses in security upon boot and be able to exploit them.

"21157","","","WARNING","192.168.56.115","tcp","0","Unix Compliance Checks","Compliance checks for Unix systems","""1.5.2 Ensure bootloader password is set - set superusers"" : [WARNING]

Setting the boot loader password will require that anyone rebooting the system must enter a password before being able to set command line boot parameters

Rationale:

Requiring a boot password upon execution of the boot loader will prevent an unauthorized user from entering boot parameters or changing the boot partition. This prevents users from weakening security (e.g. turning off AppArmor at boot time).

Solution:
Create an encrypted password with grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2:

# grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2
Enter password: <password>
Reenter password: <password>
PBKDF2 hash of your password is <encrypted-password>

Add the following into a custom /etc/grub.d configuration file:

cat <<EOF
set superusers='<username>'
password_pbkdf2 <username> <encrypted-password>
EOF

The superuser/user information and password should not be contained in the /etc/grub.d/00_header file as this file could be overwritten in a package update.
If there is a requirement to be able to boot/reboot without entering the password, edit /etc/grub.d/10_linux and add --unrestricted to the line CLASS=
Example:

CLASS='--class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os --unrestricted'

Run the following command to update the grub2 configuration:

# update-grub

Impact:

If password protection is enabled, only the designated superuser can edit a Grub 2 menu item by pressing 'e' or access the GRUB 2 command line by pressing 'c'

If GRUB 2 is set up to boot automatically to a password-protected menu entry the user has no option to back out of the password prompt to select another menu entry. Holding the SHIFT key will not display the menu in this case. The user must enter the correct username and password. If unable, the configuration files will have to be edited via the LiveCD or other means to fix the problem

You can add --unrestricted to the menu entries to allow the system to boot without entering a password. Password will still be required to edit menu items.

Setting the boot loader password will require that anyone rebooting the system must enter a password before being able to set command line boot parameters

Rationale:

Requiring a boot password upon execution of the boot loader will prevent an unauthorized user from entering boot parameters or changing the boot partition. This prevents users from weakening security (e.g. turning off AppArmor at boot time).

Recent processors in the x86 family support the ability to prevent code execution on a per memory page basis. Generically and on AMD processors, this ability is called No Execute (NX), while on Intel processors it is called Execute Disable (XD). This ability can help prevent exploitation of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and should be activated whenever possible. Extra steps must be taken to ensure that this protection is enabled, particularly on 32-bit x86 systems. Other processors, such as Itanium and POWER, have included such support since inception and the standard kernel for those platforms supports the feature.

Rationale:

Enabling any feature that can protect against buffer overflow attacks enhances the security of the system.

Solution:
On 32 bit systems install a kernel with PAE support, no installation is required on 64 bit systems:
If necessary configure your bootloader to load the new kernel and reboot the system.
You may need to enable NX or XD support in your bios.

Notes:

Ensure your system supports the XD or NX bit and has PAE support before implementing this recommendation as this may prevent it from booting if these are not supported by your hardware.

Add the following line to /etc/security/limits.conf or a /etc/security/limits.d/* file:

* hard core 0

Set the following parameter in /etc/sysctl.conf or a /etc/sysctl.d/* file:

fs.suid_dumpable = 0

Run the following command to set the active kernel parameter:

# sysctl -w fs.suid_dumpable=0

If systemd-coredump is installed:
edit /etc/systemd/coredump.conf and add/modify the following lines:

Storage=none
ProcessSizeMax=0

Run the command:

systemctl daemon-reload

Unix-based systems have typically displayed information about the OS release and patch level upon logging in to the system.

Periodically patches are released for included software either due to security flaws or to include additional functionality.

Rationale:

Newer patches may contain security enhancements that would not be available through the latest full update. As a result, it is recommended that the latest software patches be used to take advantage of the latest functionality. As with any software installation, organizations need to determine if a given update meets their requirements and verify the compatibility and supportability of any additional software against the update revision that is selected.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.

Solution:
Use your package manager to update all packages on the system according to site policy.
Run the following command to update all packages following local site policy guidance on applying updates and patches:

# apt upgrade
OR
# apt dist-upgrade

Notes:

Site policy may mandate a testing period before install onto production systems for available updates.

upgrade: upgrade is used to install the newest versions of all packages currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in /etc/apt/sources.list. Packages currently installed with new versions available are retrieved and upgraded; under no circumstances are currently installed packages removed, or packages not already installed retrieved and installed. New versions of currently installed packages that cannot be upgraded without changing the install status of another package will be left at their current version. An update must be performed first so that apt knows that new versions of packages are available.

dist-upgrade: dist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of upgrade, also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions of packages; apt has a 'smart' conflict resolution system, and it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the expense of less important ones if necessary. So, dist-upgrade command may remove some packages. The /etc/apt/sources.list file contains a list of locations from which to retrieve desired package files. See also apt_preferences(5) for a mechanism for overriding the general settings for individual packages.

System time should be synchronized between all systems in an environment. This is typically done by establishing an authoritative time server or set of servers and having all systems synchronize their clocks to them.

Rationale:

Time synchronization is important to support time sensitive security mechanisms like Kerberos and also ensures log files have consistent time records across the enterprise, which aids in forensic investigations.

Solution:
On systems where host based time synchronization is not available, configure systemd-timesyncd. If 'full featured' and/or encrypted time synchronization is required, install chrony or NTP.
To install chrony:

# atp install chrony

To install ntp:

# apt install ntp

On virtual systems where host based time synchronization is available consult your virtualization software documentation and setup host based synchronization.

Notes:

systemd-timesyncd is part of systemd. Some versions of systemd have been compiled without systemd-timesycnd. On these distributions, chrony or NTP should be used instead of systemd-timesycnd.

systemd-timesyncd is a daemon that has been added for synchronizing the system clock across the network. It implements an SNTP client. In contrast to NTP implementations such as chrony or the NTP reference server this only implements a client side, and does not bother with the full NTP complexity, focusing only on querying time from one remote server and synchronizing the local clock to it. The daemon runs with minimal privileges, and has been hooked up with networkd to only operate when network connectivity is available. The daemon saves the current clock to disk every time a new NTP sync has been acquired, and uses this to possibly correct the system clock early at bootup, in order to accommodate for systems that lack an RTC such as the Raspberry Pi and embedded devices, and make sure that time monotonically progresses on these systems, even if it is not always correct. To make use of this daemon a new system user and group 'systemd-timesync' needs to be created on installation of systemd.

Note: The systemd-timesyncd service specifically implements only SNTP. This minimalistic service will set the system clock for large offsets or slowly adjust it for smaller deltas. More complex use cases are not covered by systemd-timesyncd.

This recommendation only applies if timesyncd is in use on the system.

Rationale:

Proper configuration is vital to ensuring time synchronization is working properly.

systemd-timesyncd is a daemon that has been added for synchronizing the system clock across the network. It implements an SNTP client. In contrast to NTP implementations such as chrony or the NTP reference server this only implements a client side, and does not bother with the full NTP complexity, focusing only on querying time from one remote server and synchronizing the local clock to it. The daemon runs with minimal privileges, and has been hooked up with networkd to only operate when network connectivity is available. The daemon saves the current clock to disk every time a new NTP sync has been acquired, and uses this to possibly correct the system clock early at bootup, in order to accommodate for systems that lack an RTC such as the Raspberry Pi and embedded devices, and make sure that time monotonically progresses on these systems, even if it is not always correct. To make use of this daemon a new system user and group 'systemd-timesync' needs to be created on installation of systemd.

Note: The systemd-timesyncd service specifically implements only SNTP. This minimalistic service will set the system clock for large offsets or slowly adjust it for smaller deltas. More complex use cases are not covered by systemd-timesyncd.

This recommendation only applies if timesyncd is in use on the system.

Rationale:

Proper configuration is vital to ensuring time synchronization is working properly.

Solution:
Run the following command to enable systemd-timesyncd

# systemctl enable systemd-timesyncd.service

edit the file /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf and add/modify the following lines:

NTP=0.debian.pool.ntp.org 1.debian.pool.ntp.org #Servers listed should be In Accordence With Local Policy

FallbackNTP=2.debian.pool.ntp.org 3.debian.pool.ntp.org #Servers listed should be In Accordence With Local Policy

RootDistanceMax=1 #should be In Accordence With Local Policy

Run the following commands to start systemd-timesyncd.service

# systemctl start systemd-timesyncd.service

# timedatectl set-ntp true

Notes:

some versions of systemd have been compiled without systemd-timesycnd. On these distributions, chrony or NTP should be used instead of systemd-timesycnd.

The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) server is used to listen for SNMP commands from an SNMP management system, execute the commands or collect the information and then send results back to the requesting system.

Rationale:

The SNMP server can communicate using SNMP v1, which transmits data in the clear and does not require authentication to execute commands. Unless absolutely necessary, it is recommended that the SNMP service not be used. If SNMP is required the server should be configured to disallow SNMP v1.

Solution:
Run the following command to disable snmpd:

# systemctl --now disable snmpd

Mail Transfer Agents (MTA), such as sendmail and Postfix, are used to listen for incoming mail and transfer the messages to the appropriate user or mail server. If the system is not intended to be a mail server, it is recommended that the MTA be configured to only process local mail.

Rationale:

The software for all Mail Transfer Agents is complex and most have a long history of security issues. While it is important to ensure that the system can process local mail messages, it is not necessary to have the MTA's daemon listening on a port unless the server is intended to be a mail server that receives and processes mail from other systems.

Removing the LDAP client will prevent or inhibit using LDAP for authentication in your environment.

Notes:

The openldap-clients package can go by other names on some distributions. openldap2-client, and ldap-utils are known alternative package names.","https://workbench.cisecurity.org/files/2658",""

Wireless networking is used when wired networks are unavailable. Debian contains a wireless tool kit to allow system administrators to configure and use wireless networks.

Rationale:

If wireless is not to be used, wireless devices can be disabled to reduce the potential attack surface.

Solution:
Run the following command to disable any wireless interfaces:

# nmcli radio all off

Impact:

Many if not all laptop workstations and some desktop workstations will connect via wireless requiring these interfaces be enabled.

ICMP Redirects are used to send routing information to other hosts. As a host itself does not act as a router (in a host only configuration), there is no need to send redirects.

Rationale:

An attacker could use a compromised host to send invalid ICMP redirects to other router devices in an attempt to corrupt routing and have users access a system set up by the attacker as opposed to a valid system.

Solution:
Set the following parameters in /etc/sysctl.conf or a /etc/sysctl.d/* file:

net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0

In networking, source routing allows a sender to partially or fully specify the route packets take through a network. In contrast, non-source routed packets travel a path determined by routers in the network. In some cases, systems may not be routable or reachable from some locations (e.g. private addresses vs. Internet routable), and so source routed packets would need to be used.

Setting net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route, net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route, net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route and net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_source_route to 0 disables the system from accepting source routed packets. Assume this system was capable of routing packets to Internet routable addresses on one interface and private addresses on another interface. Assume that the private addresses were not routable to the Internet routable addresses and vice versa. Under normal routing circumstances, an attacker from the Internet routable addresses could not use the system as a way to reach the private address systems. If, however, source routed packets were allowed, they could be used to gain access to the private address systems as the route could be specified, rather than rely on routing protocols that did not allow this routing.

Solution:
Set the following parameters in /etc/sysctl.conf or a /etc/sysctl.d/* file:

net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0

Run the following commands to set the active kernel parameters:

# sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route=0
# sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route=0
# sysctl -w net.ipv4.route.flush=1

IF IPv6 is enabled:
Set the following parameters in /etc/sysctl.conf or a /etc/sysctl.d/* file:

net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0

Run the following commands to set the active kernel parameters:

# sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route=0

In networking, source routing allows a sender to partially or fully specify the route packets take through a network. In contrast, non-source routed packets travel a path determined by routers in the network. In some cases, systems may not be routable or reachable from some locations (e.g. private addresses vs. Internet routable), and so source routed packets would need to be used.

Rationale:

Setting net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route, net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route, net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route and net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_source_route to 0 disables the system from accepting source routed packets. Assume this system was capable of routing packets to Internet routable addresses on one interface and private addresses on another interface. Assume that the private addresses were not routable to the Internet routable addresses and vice versa. Under normal routing circumstances, an attacker from the Internet routable addresses could not use the system as a way to reach the private address systems. If, however, source routed packets were allowed, they could be used to gain access to the private address systems as the route could be specified, rather than rely on routing protocols that did not allow this routing.

Solution:

ICMP redirect messages are packets that convey routing information and tell your host (acting as a router) to send packets via an alternate path. It is a way of allowing an outside routing device to update your system routing tables. By setting net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects and net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_redirects to 0, the system will not accept any ICMP redirect messages, and therefore, won't allow outsiders to update the system's routing tables.

Rationale:

Attackers could use bogus ICMP redirect messages to maliciously alter the system routing tables and get them to send packets to incorrect networks and allow your system packets to be captured.

Solution:
Set the following parameters in /etc/sysctl.conf or a /etc/sysctl.d/* file:

net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects = 0

Run the following commands to set the active kernel parameters:

Setting net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts to 1 will cause the system to ignore all ICMP echo and timestamp requests to broadcast and multicast addresses.

Rationale:

Accepting ICMP echo and timestamp requests with broadcast or multicast destinations for your network could be used to trick your host into starting (or participating) in a Smurf attack. A Smurf attack relies on an attacker sending large amounts of ICMP broadcast messages with a spoofed source address. All hosts receiving this message and responding would send echo-reply messages back to the spoofed address, which is probably not routable. If many hosts respond to the packets, the amount of traffic on the network could be significantly multiplied.

When tcp_syncookies is set, the kernel will handle TCP SYN packets normally until the half-open connection queue is full, at which time, the SYN cookie functionality kicks in. SYN cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the SYN with a SYN|ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the system to verify that it has received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no corresponding SYN in the queue.

Rationale:

Attackers use SYN flood attacks to perform a denial of service attacked on a system by sending many SYN packets without completing the three way handshake. This will quickly use up slots in the kernel's half-open connection queue and prevent legitimate connections from succeeding. SYN cookies allow the system to keep accepting valid connections, even if under a denial of service attack.

Attackers use SYN flood attacks to perform a denial of service attacked on a system by sending many SYN packets without completing the three way handshake. This will quickly use up slots in the kernel's half-open connection queue and prevent legitimate connections from succeeding. SYN cookies allow the system to keep accepting valid connections, even if under a denial of service attack.

Solution:
Set the following parameters in /etc/sysctl.conf or a /etc/sysctl.d/* file:

net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1

Run the following commands to set the active kernel parameters:

# sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1

# sysctl -w net.ipv4.route.flush=1

UncomplicatedFirewall (ufw) is a frontend for iptables. ufw provides a framework for managing netfilter, as well as a command-line and available graphical user interface for manipulating the firewall.

Ensure that the ufw service is enabled to protect your system.

Rationale:

The ufw service must be enabled and running in order for ufw to protect the system

Solution:
Run the following command to enable ufw:

# ufw enable

Impact:

Changing firewall settings while connected over network can result in being locked out of the system.

References:

http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man8/ufw.8.html

Notes:

When running ufw enable or starting ufw via its initscript, ufw will flush its chains. This is required so ufw can maintain a consistent state, but it may drop existing connections (eg ssh). ufw does support adding rules before enabling the firewall.

Run the following command before running ufw enable.

# ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 22

The rules will still be flushed, but the ssh port will be open after enabling the firewall. Please note that once ufw is 'enabled', ufw will not flush the chains when adding or removing rules (but will when modifying a rule or changing the default policy).

By default, ufw will prompt when enabling the firewall while running under ssh. This can be disabled by using ufw --force enable.

The loopback interface is the only place that loopback network (127.0.0.0/8 for IPv4 and ::1/128 for IPv6) traffic should be seen, all other interfaces should ignore traffic on this network as an anti-spoofing measure.

Solution:
Run the following commands to implement the loopback rules:

# ufw allow in on lo

# ufw allow out from lo

# sudo ufw deny in from 127.0.0.0/8

# sudo ufw deny in from ::1

Configure the firewall rules for new outbound connections.

Rationale:

If rules are not in place for new outbound connections all packets will be dropped by the default policy preventing network usage.

Solution:
Configure ufw in accordance with site policy. The following commands will implement a policy to allow all outbound connections on all interfaces:

# ufw allow out on all

Notes:

Changing firewall settings while connected over network can result in being locked out of the system. Unlike iptables, when a new outbound rule is added, ufw automatically takes care of associated established connections, so no rules for the latter kind are required.

Any ports that have been opened on non-loopback addresses need firewall rules to govern traffic.

Rationale:

Without a firewall rule configured for open ports default firewall policy will drop all packets to these ports.

Solution:
For each port identified in the audit which does not have a firewall rule establish a proper rule for accepting inbound connections:

# ufw allow in <port>/<tcp or udp protocol>

Notes:

Changing firewall settings while connected over network can result in being locked out of the system.

Rationale:

Loopback traffic is generated between processes on machine and is typically critical to operation of the system. The loopback interface is the only place that loopback network traffic should be seen, all other interfaces should ignore traffic on this network as an anti-spoofing measure.

Base chain policy is the default verdict that will be applied to packets reaching the end of the chain.

Rationale:

There are two policies: accept (Default) and drop. If the policy is set to accept, the firewall will accept any packet that is not configured to be denied and the packet will continue transversing the network stack.

It is easier to white list acceptable usage than to black list unacceptable usage.

Solution:
Run the following command for the base chains with the input, forward, and output hooks to implement a default DROP policy:

# nft chain inet filter input { policy drop ; }

nftables is a subsystem of the Linux kernel providing filtering and classification of network packets/datagrams/frames.

The nftables service reads the /etc/nftables.conf file for a nftables file or files to include in the nftables ruleset.

A nftables ruleset containing the input, forward, and output base chains allow network traffic to be filtered.

Rationale:

Changes made to nftables ruleset only affect the live system, you will also need to configure the nftables ruleset to apply on boot

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.

Solution:
Edit the /etc/nftables.conf file and un-comment or add a line with include <Absolute path to nftables rules file> for each nftables file you want included in the nftables ruleset on boot

Any ports that have been opened on non-loopback addresses need firewall rules to govern traffic.

Rationale:

Without a firewall rule configured for open ports default firewall policy will drop all packets to these ports.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.

Solution:
For each port identified in the audit which does not have a firewall rule establish a proper rule for accepting inbound connections:

# ip6tables -A INPUT -p <protocol> --dport <port> -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT

Changing firewall settings while connected over network can result in being locked out of the system.

"21157","","","PASSED","192.168.56.115","tcp","0","Unix Compliance Checks","Compliance checks for Unix systems","""4.2.1.2 Ensure rsyslog Service is enabled"" : [PASSED]

Once the rsyslog package is installed it needs to be activated.

Rationale:

If the rsyslog service is not activated the system may default to the syslogd service or lack logging instead.

Solution:
Run the following commands to enable rsyslog:

# systemctl --now enable rsyslog

Notes:

Additional methods of enabling a service exist. Consult your distribution documentation for appropriate methods.

The /etc/rsyslog.conf and /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf files specifies rules for logging and which files are to be used to log certain classes of messages.

Rationale:

A great deal of important security-related information is sent via rsyslog (e.g., successful and failed su attempts, failed login attempts, root login attempts, etc.).

Solution:
Edit the following lines in the /etc/rsyslog.conf and /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf files as appropriate for your environment:

*.emerg                                  :omusrmsg:*
auth,authpriv.*                          /var/log/auth.log

Run the following command to reload the rsyslog configuration:

# systemctl reload rsyslog

Notes:

The rsyslog utility supports the ability to send logs it gathers to a remote log host running syslogd(8) or to receive messages from remote hosts, reducing administrative overhead.

Rationale:

Storing log data on a remote host protects log integrity from local attacks. If an attacker gains root access on the local system, they could tamper with or remove log data that is stored on the local system

Solution:

The journald system includes the capability of compressing overly large files to avoid filling up the system with logs or making the logs unmanageably large.

"21157","","","WARNING","192.168.56.115","tcp","0","Unix Compliance Checks","Compliance checks for Unix systems","""4.3 Ensure logrotate is configured"" : [WARNING]

The system includes the capability of rotating log files regularly to avoid filling up the system with logs or making the logs unmanageably large. The file /etc/logrotate.d/rsyslog is the configuration file used to rotate log files created by rsyslog.

Rationale:

By keeping the log files smaller and more manageable, a system administrator can easily archive these files to another system and spend less time looking through inordinately large log files.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance.

Solution:
Edit /etc/logrotate.conf and /etc/logrotate.d/rsyslog to ensure logs are rotated according to site policy.

Notes:

If no maxage setting is set for logrotate a situation can occur where logrotate is interrupted and fails to delete rotated logfiles. It is recommended to set this to a value greater than the longest any log file should exist on your system to ensure that any such logfile is removed but standard rotation settings are not overridden.

The cron daemon is used to execute batch jobs on the system.

Rationale:

While there may not be user jobs that need to be run on the system, the system does have maintenance jobs that may include security monitoring that have to run, and cron is used to execute them.

Solution:
Based on your system configuration, run the appropriate one of the following commands to enable cron:

# systemctl --now enable cron

Notes:

Additional methods of enabling a service exist. Consult your distribution documentation for appropriate methods.

The /etc/crontab file is used by cron to control its own jobs. The commands in this item make sure that root is the user and group owner of the file and that only the owner can access the file.

Rationale:

This file contains information on what system jobs are run by cron. Write access to these files could provide unprivileged users with the ability to elevate their privileges. Read access to these files could provide users with the ability to gain insight on system jobs that run on the system and could provide them a way to gain unauthorized privileged access.

Configure /etc/cron.allow and /etc/at.allow to allow specific users to use these services. If /etc/cron.allow or /etc/at.allow do not exist, then /etc/at.deny and /etc/cron.deny are checked. Any user not specifically defined in those files is allowed to use at and cron. By removing the files, only users in /etc/cron.allow and /etc/at.allow are allowed to use at and cron. Note that even though a given user is not listed in cron.allow , cron jobs can still be run as that user. The cron.allow file only controls administrative access to the crontab command for scheduling and modifying cron jobs.

Rationale:

On many systems, only the system administrator is authorized to schedule cron jobs. Using the cron.allow file to control who can run cron jobs enforces this policy. It is easier to manage an allow list than a deny list. In a deny list, you could potentially add a user ID to the system and forget to add it to the deny files.

INFO level is the basic level that only records login activity of SSH users. In many situations, such as Incident Response, it is important to determine when a particular user was active on a system. The logout record can eliminate those users who disconnected, which helps narrow the field.

VERBOSE level specifies that login and logout activity as well as the key fingerprint for any SSH key used for login will be logged. This information is important for SSH key management, especially in legacy environments.

Rationale:

SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity. DEBUG is specifically not recommended other than strictly for debugging SSH communications since it provides so much data that it is difficult to identify important security information.

Solution:
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows:

LogLevel VERBOSE

This variable limits the ciphers that SSH can use during communication.

Rationale:

Weak ciphers that are used for authentication to the cryptographic module cannot be relied upon to provide confidentiality or integrity, and system data may be compromised

The DES, Triple DES, and Blowfish ciphers, as used in SSH, have a birthday bound of approximately four billion blocks, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain cleartext data via a birthday attack against a long-duration encrypted session, aka a 'Sweet32' attack

The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, does not properly combine state data with key data during the initialization phase, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct plaintext-recovery attacks against the initial bytes of a stream by sniffing network traffic that occasionally relies on keys affected by the Invariance Weakness, and then using a brute-force approach involving LSB values, aka the 'Bar Mitzvah' issue

The passwords used during an SSH session encrypted with RC4 can be recovered by an attacker who is able to capture and replay the session

Error handling in the SSH protocol; Client and Server, when using a block cipher algorithm in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, makes it easier for remote attackers to recover certain plaintext data from an arbitrary block of ciphertext in an SSH session via unknown vectors

The mm_newkeys_from_blob function in monitor_wrap.c, when an AES-GCM cipher is used, does not properly initialize memory for a MAC context data structure, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended ForceCommand and login-shell restrictions via packet data that provides a crafted callback address

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.

"21157","","","PASSED","192.168.56.115","tcp","0","Unix Compliance Checks","Compliance checks for Unix systems","""5.2.14 Ensure only strong MAC algorithms are used"" : [PASSED]

This variable limits the types of MAC algorithms that SSH can use during communication.

Rationale:

MD5 and 96-bit MAC algorithms are considered weak and have been shown to increase exploitability in SSH downgrade attacks. Weak algorithms continue to have a great deal of attention as a weak spot that can be exploited with expanded computing power. An attacker that breaks the algorithm could take advantage of a MiTM position to decrypt the SSH tunnel and capture credentials and information

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.

Solution:
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and add/modify the MACs line to contain a comma separated list of the site approved MACs
Example:

MACs hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha2-256

Default Value:

Key exchange is any method in cryptography by which cryptographic keys are exchanged between two parties, allowing use of a cryptographic algorithm. If the sender and receiver wish to exchange encrypted messages, each must be equipped to encrypt messages to be sent and decrypt messages received

Rationale:

Key exchange methods that are considered weak should be removed. A key exchange method may be weak because too few bits are used, or the hashing algorithm is considered too weak. Using weak algorithms could expose connections to man-in-the-middle attacks

The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of ssh sessions. When the ClientAliveInterval variable is set, ssh sessions that have no activity for the specified length of time are terminated. When the ClientAliveCountMax variable is set, sshd will send client alive messages at every ClientAliveInterval interval. When the number of consecutive client alive messages are sent with no response from the client, the ssh session is terminated. For example, if the ClientAliveInterval is set to 15 seconds and the ClientAliveCountMax is set to 3, the client ssh session will be terminated after 45 seconds of idle time.

Rationale:

Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user access to another user's ssh session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the screen). Setting a timeout value at least reduces the risk of this happening..

While the recommended setting is 300 seconds (5 minutes), set this timeout value based on site policy. The recommended setting for ClientAliveCountMax is 0. In this case, the client session will be terminated after 5 minutes of idle time and no keepalive messages will be sent.

There are several options available to limit which users and group can access the system via SSH. It is recommended that at least one of the following options be leveraged:

AllowUsers

The AllowUsers variable gives the system administrator the option of allowing specific users to ssh into the system. The list consists of space separated user names. Numeric user IDs are not recognized with this variable. If a system administrator wants to restrict user access further by only allowing the allowed users to log in from a particular host, the entry can be specified in the form of user@host.

AllowGroups

The AllowGroups variable gives the system administrator the option of allowing specific groups of users to ssh into the system. The list consists of space separated group names. Numeric group IDs are not recognized with this variable.

DenyUsers

The DenyUsers variable gives the system administrator the option of denying specific users to ssh into the system. The list consists of space separated user names. Numeric user IDs are not recognized with this variable. If a system administrator wants to restrict user access further by specifically denying a user's access from a particular host, the entry can be specified in the form of user@host.

DenyGroups

The DenyGroups variable gives the system administrator the option of denying specific groups of users to ssh into the system. The list consists of space separated group names. Numeric group IDs are not recognized with this variable.

UsePAM Enables the Pluggable Authentication Module interface. If set to 'yes' this will enable PAM authentication using ChallengeResponseAuthentication and PasswordAuthentication in addition to PAM account and session module processing for all authentication types

Rationale:

When usePAM is set to yes, PAM runs through account and session types properly. This is important if you want to restrict access to services based off of IP, time or other factors of the account. Additionally, you can make sure users inherit certain environment variables on login or disallow access to the server

Solution:
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows:

UsePAM yes

Impact:

If UsePAM is enabled, you will not be able to run sshd(8) as a non-root user.

Default Value:

usePAM yes

The pam_pwquality.so module checks the strength of passwords. It performs checks such as making sure a password is not a dictionary word, it is a certain length, contains a mix of characters (e.g. alphabet, numeric, other) and more. The following are definitions of the pam_pwquality.so options.

The following options are set in the /etc/security/pwquality.conf file:

Password Length:

minlen = 14 - password must be 14 characters or more

Password complexity:

minclass = 4 - The minimum number of required classes of characters for the new password (digits, uppercase, lowercase, others)

OR

dcredit = -1 - provide at least one digit

ucredit = -1 - provide at least one uppercase character

ocredit = -1 - provide at least one special character

lcredit = -1 - provide at least one lowercase character

The following is st in the /etc/pam.d/common-password file

retry=3 - Allow 3 tries before sending back a failure.

Note: If a user has been locked out because they have reached the maximum consecutive failure count defined by deny= in the pam_tally2.so module, the user can be unlocked by issuing the command /sbin/pam_tally2 -u <username> --reset. This command sets the failed count to 0, effectively unlocking the user.

Notes:

BUG In pam_tally2.so

To work around this issue you have to add pam_tally2 to the account section account required pam_tally2.so for the counter to reset to 0 when using sudo

Use of the 'audit' keyword may log credentials in the case of user error during authentication. This risk should be evaluated in the context of the site policies of your organization.

The /etc/security/opasswd file stores the users' old passwords and can be checked to ensure that users are not recycling recent passwords.

Rationale:

Forcing users not to reuse their past 5 passwords make it less likely that an attacker will be able to guess the password.

The commands below change password encryption from md5 to sha512 (a much stronger hashing algorithm). All existing accounts will need to perform a password change to upgrade the stored hashes to the new algorithm.

Rationale:

The SHA-512 algorithm provides much stronger hashing than MD5, thus providing additional protection to the system by increasing the level of effort for an attacker to successfully determine passwords.

Note that these change only apply to accounts configured on the local system.

Solution:
Edit the /etc/pam.d/common-password file to include the sha512 option for pam_unix.so as shown:

Notes:

Consult your documentation for the appropriate PAM file and module.

Additional module options may be set, recommendation only covers those listed here.

If it is determined that the password algorithm being used is not SHA-512, once it is changed, it is recommended that all user ID's be immediately expired and forced to change their passwords on next login. To accomplish that, the following commands can be used. Any system accounts that need to be expired should be carefully done separately by the system administrator to prevent any potential problems.

The PASS_MAX_DAYS parameter in /etc/login.defs allows an administrator to force passwords to expire once they reach a defined age. It is recommended that the PASS_MAX_DAYS parameter be set to less than or equal to 365 days.

Rationale:

The window of opportunity for an attacker to leverage compromised credentials or successfully compromise credentials via an online brute force attack is limited by the age of the password. Therefore, reducing the maximum age of a password also reduces an attacker's window of opportunity.

All users should have a password change date in the past.

Rationale:

If a users recorded password change date is in the future then they could bypass any set password expiration.

Solution:
Investigate any users with a password change date in the future and correct them. Locking the account, expiring the password, or resetting the password manually may be appropriate.

"21157","","","PASSED","192.168.56.115","tcp","0","Unix Compliance Checks","Compliance checks for Unix systems","""5.4.2 Ensure system accounts are secured"" : [PASSED]

There are a number of accounts provided with most distributions that are used to manage applications and are not intended to provide an interactive shell.

Rationale:

It is important to make sure that accounts that are not being used by regular users are prevented from being used to provide an interactive shell. By default, most distributions set the password field for these accounts to an invalid string, but it is also recommended that the shell field in the password file be set to the nologin shell. This prevents the account from potentially being used to run any commands.

Solution:
Run the commands appropriate for your distribution:
Set the shell for any accounts returned by the audit to nologin:

# usermod -s $(which nologin) <user>

Lock any non root accounts returned by the audit:

# usermod -L <user>

The following command will set all system accounts to a non login shell:

awk -F: '($1!='root' && $1!='sync' && $1!='shutdown' && $1!='halt' && $1!~/^+/ && $3<''$(awk '/^s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs)'' && $7!='''$(which nologin)''' && $7!='/bin/false') {print $1}' /etc/passwd | while read -r user; do usermod -s '$(which nologin)' '$user'; done

The following command will automatically lock not root system accounts:

awk -F: '($1!='root' && $1!~/^+/ && $3<''$(awk '/^s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs)'') {print $1}' /etc/passwd | xargs -I '{}' passwd -S '{}' | awk '($2!='L' && $2!='LK') {print $1}' | while read -r user; do usermod -L '$user'; done

Notes:

The root, sync, shutdown, and halt users are exempted from requiring a non-login shell.

The default umask determines the permissions of files created by users. The user creating the file has the discretion of making their files and directories readable by others via the chmod command. Users who wish to allow their files and directories to be readable by others by default may choose a different default umask by inserting the umask command into the standard shell configuration files ( .profile , .bashrc , etc.) in their home directories.

Rationale:

Setting a very secure default value for umask ensures that users make a conscious choice about their file permissions. A default umask setting of 077 causes files and directories created by users to not be readable by any other user on the system. A umask of 027 would make files and directories readable by users in the same Unix group, while a umask of 022 would make files readable by every user on the system.

Normally, the su command can be executed by any user. By uncommenting the pam_wheel.so statement in /etc/pam.d/su , the su command will only allow users in a specific groups to execute su. This group should be empty to reinforce the use of sudo for privileged access.

Rationale:

Restricting the use of su , and using sudo in its place, provides system administrators better control of the escalation of user privileges to execute privileged commands. The sudo utility also provides a better logging and audit mechanism, as it can log each command executed via sudo , whereas su can only record that a user executed the su program.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.

Solution:
Create an empty group that will be specified for use of the su command. The group should be named according to site policy.
Example

# groupadd sugroup

Add the following line to the /etc/pam.d/su file, specifying the empty group:

auth required pam_wheel.so use_uid group=sugroup

Unix-based systems support variable settings to control access to files. World writable files are the least secure. See the chmod(2) man page for more information.

Rationale:

Data in world-writable files can be modified and compromised by any user on the system. World writable files may also indicate an incorrectly written script or program that could potentially be the cause of a larger compromise to the system's integrity.

Solution:
Removing write access for the 'other' category ( chmod o-w <filename> ) is advisable, but always consult relevant vendor documentation to avoid breaking any application dependencies on a given file.

The owner of a file can set the file's permissions to run with the owner's or group's permissions, even if the user running the program is not the owner or a member of the group. The most common reason for a SUID program is to enable users to perform functions (such as changing their password) that require root privileges.

Rationale:

There are valid reasons for SUID programs, but it is important to identify and review such programs to ensure they are legitimate.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.

The owner of a file can set the file's permissions to run with the owner's or group's permissions, even if the user running the program is not the owner or a member of the group. The most common reason for a SGID program is to enable users to perform functions (such as changing their password) that require root privileges.

Rationale:

There are valid reasons for SGID programs, but it is important to identify and review such programs to ensure they are legitimate. Review the files returned by the action in the audit section and check to see if system binaries have a different md5 checksum than what from the package. This is an indication that the binary may have been replaced.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.

Solution:
Ensure that no rogue SGID programs have been introduced into the system. Review the files returned by the action in the Audit section and confirm the integrity of these binaries.

An account with an empty password field means that anybody may log in as that user without providing a password.

Rationale:

All accounts must have passwords or be locked to prevent the account from being used by an unauthorized user.

Solution:
If any accounts in the /etc/shadow file do not have a password, run the following command to lock the account until it can be determined why it does not have a password:

# passwd -l <username>

Also, check to see if the account is logged in and investigate what it is being used for to determine if it needs to be forced off.

While the system administrator can establish secure permissions for users' home directories, the users can easily override these.

While the system administrator can establish secure permissions for users' 'dot' files, the users can easily override these.

Rationale:

Group or world-writable user configuration files may enable malicious users to steal or modify other users' data or to gain another user's system privileges.

Solution:
Making global modifications to users' files without alerting the user community can result in unexpected outages and unhappy users. Therefore, it is recommended that a monitoring policy be established to report user dot file permissions and determine the action to be taken in accordance with site policy.

The shadow group allows system programs which require access the ability to read the /etc/shadow file. No users should be assigned to the shadow group.

Rationale:

Any users assigned to the shadow group would be granted read access to the /etc/shadow file. If attackers can gain read access to the /etc/shadow file, they can easily run a password cracking program against the hashed passwords to break them. Other security information that is stored in the /etc/shadow file (such as expiration) could also be useful to subvert additional user accounts.

Solution:
Remove all users from the shadow group, and change the primary group of any users with shadow as their primary group.
